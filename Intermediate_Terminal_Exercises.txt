kill or kill -9 <PID>.

The difference between kill and kill -9 is that kill instructs programs to quit, while kill -9 finds the command to quit the program and them executes that specific command. The difference is that programs may or may not respond to the normal kill command if they have a procedure to do before quitting, while the kill -9 command simply quits the program in regardless of what should be done before quitting.
