man displays documentation for commands. It shows different uses of the command and what the flags do. You can scroll using j and k or f and b. To get out use q.

The l flag displays files using long format. The a flag displays files that begin with a dot. Long format shows access, user, group, file size, and time.

You can jump between word by holding alt and pressing the left and right arrows.

You can jump to the end and start of a line using control a and e.

You can delete words using alt delete.

Terminal is a virtual application designed to run programs known as shells. Bash and zsh are shells. iterm is another example of a terminal.

An absolute path is a path that starts from the root for ~ folder.

A relative path is a path that starts at whatever folder you are currently in. A relative path is assumed unless the path starts at ~ or /Users.

A flag is an option for how to run a command. -l is an example of a flag for ls. 

r and f flags in rm allow folders and everything inside the folder to be deleted (r) and doesnâ€™t require confirmation to do so (f). I believe r stands for recursive and f stands for forced.
